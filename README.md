## Technologies Used

* Ruby
* RSPEC 

## Description

This checker will take two inputs, both words and phrases.  It check to make sure there is at least one vowel and no numbers in the words. If that test passes, it will strip punctuation and whitespace from the inputted string.  Next, it converts the string into an array of single letters. The checker then sorts these arrays alphabetically and then checks to see if the arrays are the same.
